Database application development VM : https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/databaseappdev-vm.html

Step 1. Download and install Oracle VM VirtualBox(https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html) on your host system.

Step 2. Download the files Comparison_of_download_managers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_download_managers) (the use of a download manager is highly recommended):

Step 3. Import your VM: File > Import Appliance to launch Appliance Import Wizard. Click Choose... to browse to the directory you re-assembled all the files in and select the OTN_Developer_Day_VM.ova then click Next> to begin importing the virtual machine. It will prompt you to agree to the appropriate developer licenses while importing. You will see 'Oracle Developer Days (Powered Off)' when it is finished importing.

Step 4. Test your VM: Once the import has completed, double-click the OTN Developer Days VM. Click OK to close the Virtualbox Information dialogs. When you get to the Enterprise Linux 6 screen you can now login. (Username and password is oracle.) Allow the process to complete; it is ready when you see a terminal window, which you can close. Once you are finished working in the guest VM you can shut it down via System > Shut Down; this will return the guest VM to the Powered Off state.

If you have any questions about this process, post a message to our Virtualization Discussion Forum (use hashtag "developerday"). Otherwise, you are now ready to complete the Hands-on Database Application Development HOLs at the workshop or at your desk. See you there!
